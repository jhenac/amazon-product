Scrapes amazon website to get price and send email alert if product price is low.

I used object oriented programming for a cleaner and reusable code. Product price and product title was scraped from Amazon website.
If the price of the product was below $150.00, an alert with a shortened link was sent to an e-mail using smtplib.
